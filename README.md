## 🧠 About the Project

This project is a simple yet engaging Truth-Dare-Situation game.

The main purpose wasn’t only building the game — but also learning and deploying a complete full-stack project using:

- **AWS (Backend – first time using AWS!)**
- **Vercel (Frontend hosting)**

This project helped me understand deployment pipelines, serverless logic, and cloud infrastructure.
